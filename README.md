Welcome to Object Scatter Documentaton, a tool for the Unity game engine.
The main goal is to provide a simple solution to organically place props on your scene to speed up the level design process.

## Features:

- Spawns multiple prefabs over a bezier path area
- Randomize position, scale and rotation
- Offset the instances positions, rotations and scales
- Spread the instances with Poisson Disc Sampling, Evenly or Randomly
- Includes sample scenes with multiple examples
- Project the instances on a grid or on top of colliders

You can buy Object Scatter on the Asset Store [here](https://u3d.as/2kJE).

## Simple and Straightforward
Object Scatter is easy to use and uses only a couple of scripts to do the work for you. With only a couple of clicks you can place a lot of objects in your scene with collision filtering and using randomization properties. You can easily create pathways using simple gizmos that you can use to compose your scenario.

## Also for Artists Only
You don’t know how to program and it’s only using a nice visual scripting plugin to make your game? Don’t worry! You don’t need any programming knowledge to use Object Scatter.

## Getting Started
Go to the Samples folder and inside the Scenes folder you can explore the demos available.

Inside those scenes there will be one or multiple objects with a scatter script attached to them
